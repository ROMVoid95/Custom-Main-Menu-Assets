> This is my collection of customized material used in Modpacks i have developed/co-developed

## Mod Assets
> The assets in this repository are used with the following mods
```sh
	- Custom Main Menu 
	- Custom Loading Screen	
```

## Usage example

The repository's folder structure:
	- <Modpack Name>
		- configs
			- <mod_config_folder> *if it has one*
				- <config file>.cfg *if it has one*
			- mod_config_file.cfg
		- resources
			- <resource_folder>
				... *any folder/file that follows*
				
### Wait What?

The folder structure is meant to show the exact location of the folders/files as they appear in the root
directory of the minecraft instance. 
*for example*
The following is the root directory of the Enigmatica 2 Expert modpack
![](rootdirectory.jpg)

As you can see, this is where the folders in each modpack are located 
(all other folders in the picture may or not be present in your modpack)
