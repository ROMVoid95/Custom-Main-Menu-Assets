│   │	│	└───<filename>.cfg
│   │   └───<filename>.cfg

```
**(...)** means more folders or files may be present, this is meant to show the basic structure of the 
directories for people that may not be aware of how they work.

## How To Add To Your Modpack
The folder structure is meant to show the exact location of the folders/files as they appear in the root
directory of the minecraft instance. 

*for example*
The following is the root directory of the Enigmatica 2 Expert modpack

![](rootdirectory.jpg)

As you can see, this is where the folders in each modpack are located 
(all other folders in the picture may or not be present in your modpack)
